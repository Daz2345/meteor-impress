Meteor-impress
============

Slight modifications to impress.js allowing it to run with meteor.

Meteor has out of the box auto reload of the browser when making changes to html. This makes modification of impress.js slides really easy.


Meteor
============

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure Javascript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Documentation is available at http://docs.meteor.com/


impress.js
============

https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.
